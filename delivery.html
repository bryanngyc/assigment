                    We provide free shipping in Malaysia for local orders above RM 250.

                    You will receive a shipping confirmation email containing tracking details with tracking number, courier service and estimated arrival date after your order is dispatched. Depending on your location, delivery will normally take 1-3 business days (West Malaysia shipments), 3-5 business days (East Malaysia shipments) and 5-10 business days (international shipments) from dispatch. We’ll be sure to keep you updated with tracking information and the estimated arrival date. If you've registered an account with us, you can also follow the delivery progress under ‘My Orders’ in your Hype Vault account.
                    <br><br>
                    Please keep in mind that while we aim to always deliver within the specified times, we cannot be responsible for delays due to customs clearance, courier delays or failed payment approval.
